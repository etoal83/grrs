# grrs

grrs is a command line application to search a string in a specified file.
This app is created for my practice of getting started in programming in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
The tutorial of coding this app is available in [The CLAiR Book](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html).

## Usage

This repository already includes a compiled binary and
you can use this CLI tool just by cloning the repo.

```
## Installation
git clone https://github.com/etoal83/grrs.git the/path/you/want

## Usage
cd grrs/target/debug
./grrs <pattern> the/path/to/target/file
```

Since the packaging is still preliminary, you need to specify the path
to the executable binary or add it into your search path manually.
